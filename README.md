This repository is for the **Network analysis and visualization** workshop organized at the [Virtual Annual Conference of Comparative and International Education Society 2020 (vCIES 2020)](https://cies2020.org/) on June 17-19, 2019.

This repository includes **Lecture Videos**, **igraph R script & data files**, and **Gephi data files**.

##   1. Lecture Videos

In this folder, there are two links for the Youtube videos. 
The first video includes theory part of my lecture and the second video file is for the practice of the igraph and Gephi with the data files.

Please be aware of that the video files are not downladable and sharing with the others without a permission is prohibited.

##   2. igraph R script & data files

In this folder there is one R script for the igraph network analysis. You can download this R script to your R Studio and follow instructions of the Youtube video.

For the igraph analysis, there are two data sets from the study of [Gemnetto, Barrat, & Cattuto (2014)](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12879-014-0695-9) titled as Mitigation of infectious disease at school: Targeted class closure vs school closure, which studied the infection network at the primary school. You can also find the data of this study from [Sociopatterns](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/primary-school-temporal-network-data/). It is the open source network data platform readily available for any type of studies and researches.
