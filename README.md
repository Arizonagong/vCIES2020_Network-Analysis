# Network analysis and visualization workshop for the vCIES2020

By Byoung-gyu Gong (Arizona State University) 

This repository is for the **Network analysis and visualization** workshop organized at the [Virtual Annual Conference of Comparative and International Education Society 2020 (vCIES 2020)](https://cies2020.org/) on June 17-19, 2019.

This repository includes **Lecture Videos**, **igraph R script & data files**, and **Gephi data files**.

##   1. Lecture Videos

There are two lecture videos for this workshop. 
The first video includes theory part of my lecture and the second video file is for the practice of the igraph and Gephi with the data files.

There are two links for the video clips here bellow:

[vCIES 2020 Network Analysis Workshop: Session2. Practice](https://cies2020.org/)


Please be aware that the video files are not downladable and sharing with the others without a permission is prohibited.
This video will be accessible to general public from June 2020 through my Youtube channel and personal website.

##   2. igraph R script & data files

In this folder there is one R script for the igraph network analysis. You can download this R script to your R Studio and follow instructions of my lecture video **vCIES 2020 Network Analysis Workshop: Session2. Practice**.

For the igraph analysis, there are two data sets from the study of [Gemnetto, Barrat, & Cattuto (2014)](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12879-014-0695-9) titled as Mitigation of infectious disease at school: Targeted class closure vs school closure, which studied the infection network at the primary school. You can also find the data of this study from [Sociopatterns](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/primary-school-temporal-network-data/). It is the open source network data platform readily available for any type of studies and researches.

I will guide you to download the csv file data sets directly to the R Studio, but if you'd like to download this file and load it in the R Studio manually, you can get this file at bellow links:

##   3. Gephi data files

The lecture using Gephi for the network data analysis will also use the same data set with the igraph.
Please download the data sets from the above links.
