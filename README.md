This repository is for the **Network analysis and visualization** workshop organized at the [Virtual Annual Conference of Comparative and International Education Society 2020 (vCIES 2020)](https://cies2020.org/) on June 17-19, 2019.

This repository includes **Lecture Videos**, **igraph R script & data files**, and **Gephi data files**.

##   1. Lecture Videos

There are two lecture videos for this workshop. 
The first video includes theory part of my lecture and the second video file is for the practice of the igraph and Gephi with the data files.

There are two links for the video clips here bellow:

[vCIES 2020 Network Analysis Workshop: Session1. Theory](https://cies2020.org/)
[vCIES 2020 Network Analysis Workshop: Session2. Practice](https://cies2020.org/)



Please be aware that the video files are not downladable and sharing with the others without a permission is prohibited.
This video will be shared to the general public from June 2020 through my Youtube channel and personal website.

##   2. igraph R script & data files

In this folder there is one R script for the igraph network analysis. You can download this R script to your R Studio and follow instructions of the Youtube video.

For the igraph analysis, there are two data sets from the study of [Gemnetto, Barrat, & Cattuto (2014)](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12879-014-0695-9) titled as Mitigation of infectious disease at school: Targeted class closure vs school closure, which studied the infection network at the primary school. You can also find the data of this study from [Sociopatterns](http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/primary-school-temporal-network-data/). It is the open source network data platform readily available for any type of studies and researches.
